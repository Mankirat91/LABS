# Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML Context with Nothing Encoded


## 🧠 Description

This lab demonstrates a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in an HTML context where the server does not encode user input. It directly reflects the input back into the page without sanitization or escaping.

---

## 🔍 Vulnerability Type

* **Reflected XSS**
* Injection Point: URL query parameter (`search`)

---

## ⚔️ Exploitation Strategy

**Payload Example:**

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

* The input is reflected back directly into the HTML without escaping.
* When a script tag is injected, the browser interprets it and executes the payload.

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Executed a script in the victim’s browser, demonstrating successful XSS.
* Lab marked as solved upon triggering the payload.

---

## 🗒️ Lessons Learned

* Always encode user input before reflecting it into HTML.
* Context matters: different injection points (HTML, attribute, JS) require different defenses.
* Client-side scripts should never trust URL parameters or user-controlled content.
