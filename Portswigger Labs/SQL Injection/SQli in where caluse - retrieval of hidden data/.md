# Lab: SQL Injection in WHERE Clause Allowing Retrieval of Hidden Data



## Description

This lab demonstrates a classic **SQL Injection** vulnerability within the `WHERE` clause of a SQL statement. By manipulating the input, the attacker can bypass filters and retrieve data that should remain hidden.

---

## Vulnerability Type

* **SQL Injection (Boolean-Based)**
* Injection Point: URL query parameter (`category`)

---

## Exploitation Strategy

**Payload Used:**

```
Gifts' OR 1=1--
```

* This payload terminates the original SQL query and appends a condition (`1=1`) that always evaluates to true.
* As a result, the database returns **all product records**, ignoring the intended filter (`category=Gifts`).

---

## Outcome

* Successfully retrieved **hidden/unintended records** by breaking out of the original SQL context.
* Confirmed the vulnerability and solved the lab.

---

## Lessons Learned

* `WHERE` clause SQL injection can be exploited using basic Boolean logic (`OR 1=1--`) to bypass filters.
* Filtering user input without proper escaping or parameterization is dangerous.
* Even simple input vectors like **categories** in e-commerce queries can be entry points for attackers.
