# Lab: SQL Injection Vulnerability Allowing Login Bypass



## 🧠 Description

This lab demonstrates a **login bypass** using SQL Injection. The vulnerability lies in how the application processes the `username` field without properly sanitizing input before using it in a SQL query.

---

## 🔍 Vulnerability Type

* **SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)**
* Injection Point: Login form (username field)

---

## ⚔️ Exploitation Strategy

**Payload Used:**

```
administrator'--
```

* The payload comments out the rest of the SQL query after injecting a valid username.
* The backend query becomes:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' --' AND password = 'xyz'
  ```
* The password check is bypassed entirely.

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Gained unauthorized access to the administrator account.
* Lab successfully solved by logging in without knowing the password.

---

## 🗒️ Lessons Learned

* SQL Injection can break logic beyond data retrieval — including **authentication logic**.
* Always use **parameterized queries** or **ORMs** to prevent query tampering.
* Never trust user-controlled input in login flows.
